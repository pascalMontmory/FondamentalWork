# Legendre Progress Log

## Gaussian Lemma G probe

Added
\[
  \texttt{Math/conjecture/legendre/tools/gaussian\_lemma\_g\_probe.py}.
\]

The tested sufficient lemma was:
\[
  \exists\,1\le t\le\lfloor\sqrt{2n}\rfloor,\qquad \gcd(n,t)=1,
\]
with \(n,t\) of opposite parity, such that no prime
\[
  p\equiv1\pmod4,\qquad p\le n+1
\]
divides \(n^2+t^2\).

This lemma is false as a universal statement.  The first counterexample is
\[
  n=12.
\]
Here \(\lfloor\sqrt{24}\rfloor=4\), and the only primitive opposite-parity
candidate is \(t=1\).  But
\[
  12^2+1^2=145=5\cdot29.
\]
The other square offsets in the Legendre interval also fail:
\[
  12^2+2^2=148,\quad
  12^2+3^2=153,\quad
  12^2+4^2=160.
\]
Thus the square-offset Gaussian subfamily cannot by itself prove Legendre.

The probe nevertheless shows that the obstruction is sparse in the tested
range.  Up to \(100000\), it reports:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  \text{range} & 2\le n\le100000 \\
  \hline
  \text{failures} & 33 \\
  \text{prime witnesses} & 99966/99999 \\
  \max t & 208 \\
  \max \left(t/\lfloor\sqrt{2n}\rfloor\right) & 1 \\
  \max \text{ candidates tried before witness} & 75.
\end{array}
\]

The failure list up to \(10000\) is:
\[
\begin{gathered}
12,23,30,39,48,60,63,83,105,113,114,141,152,174,186,196,\\
408,459,592,651,678,811,921,1173,1284,2046,2058,2163,\\
2181,2376,2658,2697,3954.
\end{gathered}
\]
Since the run up to \(100000\) also reports \(33\) failures, these are all
the failures observed in that range.

The next viable target is not Lemma G as stated.  It is either:

1. prove a finite-exception version of the square-offset lemma and handle the
   exceptional classes by another offset family; or
2. use the square-offset data as a structured subcover inside the full
   residue-cover formulation.

## Gaussian failure offset analysis

Added
\[
  \texttt{Math/conjecture/legendre/tools/gaussian\_failure\_analyzer.py}.
\]
For each failure of the strict square-offset lemma, it finds the first actual
prime in the Legendre interval and writes its offset as
\[
  m=t^2+r,
\]
choosing the nearest square.

For the \(33\) strict failures observed up to \(100000\), the first prime
offset is always very close to a square:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  |r| & \text{number of failures} \\
  \hline
  1 & 14 \\
  2 & 10 \\
  3 & 7 \\
  4 & 1 \\
  5 & 1.
\end{array}
\]
Thus every observed strict failure is repaired by the broadened offset family
\[
  n^2+t^2+r,\qquad |r|\le5.
\]
The smaller band \(|r|\le4\) covers \(32/33\) failures; the unique \(|r|=5\)
case in this run is
\[
  n=1284,\qquad n^2+41=1648697,\qquad 41=6^2+5.
\]

This suggests the next experimental lemma:

Lemma \(G_5\) candidate. For every \(n\ge2\), there exist integers
\[
  1\le t\le\lfloor\sqrt{2n}\rfloor+1,\qquad |r|\le5,
\]
such that
\[
  1\le t^2+r\le 2n
\]
and \(n^2+t^2+r\) is prime.

This no longer has the clean Gaussian-norm divisor exclusion when \(r\ne0\),
but it may be the correct empirical bridge: square norms provide the main
skeleton, and a bounded correction handles the sparse failures.

## Gaussian bounded-band probe

Added
\[
  \texttt{Math/conjecture/legendre/tools/gaussian\_band\_probe.py}.
\]
For a fixed radius \(R\), it tests whether every interval has a prime of the
form
\[
  n^2+t^2+r,\qquad |r|\le R,\qquad 1\le t^2+r\le2n.
\]
The script uses deterministic Miller-Rabin for fast primality testing and
orders candidates by increasing \(|r|\), then by \(t\).

The initial \(G_5\) candidate was stronger than needed in the tested range.
For \(2\le n\le100000\), the probe found no failures with \(R=5\), and no
witness used \(|r|>2\):
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  r & \text{witness count} \\
  \hline
  -1 & 11 \\
  0 & 99966 \\
  1 & 21 \\
  2 & 1.
\end{array}
\]

Testing the smaller bands gives:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
  R & \text{range} & \text{failures} \\
  \hline
  1 & 2\le n\le1000000 & 1\quad(n=23) \\
  2 & 2\le n\le1000000 & 0.
\end{array}
\]
Thus the sharpened experimental target is now:

Lemma \(G_2\) candidate. For every \(n\ge2\), there exist integers \(t,r\)
with
\[
  |r|\le2,\qquad 1\le t^2+r\le2n,
\]
such that
\[
  n^2+t^2+r
\]
is prime.

Up to \(1000000\), the only non-square corrections needed are \(r=-1,1,2\),
and \(r=2\) occurs only for \(n=23\) in the tested range.

## Gaussian correction case analysis

Added
\[
  \texttt{Math/conjecture/legendre/tools/gaussian\_correction\_case\_analyzer.py}.
\]
It isolates the pure-square failures and compares two quantities:

1. the first actual prime in the Legendre interval;
2. the first prime found by the \(R=2\) correction-band search.

Up to \(1000000\), the pure-square failures are exactly the same \(33\) cases
already observed below \(10000\):
\[
\begin{gathered}
12,23,30,39,48,60,63,83,105,113,114,141,152,174,186,196,\\
408,459,592,651,678,811,921,1173,1284,2046,2058,2163,\\
2181,2376,2658,2697,3954.
\end{gathered}
\]
No new pure-square failure appears for
\[
  3955\le n\le1000000.
\]

Every one of the \(33\) failures is repaired by \(R=2\).  The actual repair
histogram is sharper than the symmetric band:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  r & \text{repair count} \\
  \hline
  -1 & 11 \\
  1 & 21 \\
  2 & 1.
\end{array}
\]
Thus \(r=-2\) is not used in the tested range.  The current minimal empirical
candidate is therefore the four-family offset set
\[
  m\in\{t^2-1,\ t^2,\ t^2+1,\ t^2+2\},
\]
rather than the full symmetric band \(|r|\le2\).

The first-prime offsets themselves can be farther from the nearest square:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  r_{\rm nearest} & \text{count} \\
  \hline
  -3 & 3 \\
  -2 & 10 \\
  -1 & 4 \\
  1 & 10 \\
  3 & 4 \\
  4 & 1 \\
  5 & 1.
\end{array}
\]
So the \(R=2\) family is not always capturing the first prime; it is capturing
a nearby prime later in the same interval.
