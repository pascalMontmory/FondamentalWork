# Legendre Progress Log

## Gaussian Lemma G probe

Added
\[
  \texttt{Math/conjecture/legendre/tools/gaussian\_lemma\_g\_probe.py}.
\]

The tested sufficient lemma was:
\[
  \exists\,1\le t\le\lfloor\sqrt{2n}\rfloor,\qquad \gcd(n,t)=1,
\]
with \(n,t\) of opposite parity, such that no prime
\[
  p\equiv1\pmod4,\qquad p\le n+1
\]
divides \(n^2+t^2\).

This lemma is false as a universal statement.  The first counterexample is
\[
  n=12.
\]
Here \(\lfloor\sqrt{24}\rfloor=4\), and the only primitive opposite-parity
candidate is \(t=1\).  But
\[
  12^2+1^2=145=5\cdot29.
\]
The other square offsets in the Legendre interval also fail:
\[
  12^2+2^2=148,\quad
  12^2+3^2=153,\quad
  12^2+4^2=160.
\]
Thus the square-offset Gaussian subfamily cannot by itself prove Legendre.

The probe nevertheless shows that the obstruction is sparse in the tested
range.  Up to \(100000\), it reports:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  \text{range} & 2\le n\le100000 \\
  \hline
  \text{failures} & 33 \\
  \text{prime witnesses} & 99966/99999 \\
  \max t & 208 \\
  \max \left(t/\lfloor\sqrt{2n}\rfloor\right) & 1 \\
  \max \text{ candidates tried before witness} & 75.
\end{array}
\]

The failure list up to \(10000\) is:
\[
\begin{gathered}
12,23,30,39,48,60,63,83,105,113,114,141,152,174,186,196,\\
408,459,592,651,678,811,921,1173,1284,2046,2058,2163,\\
2181,2376,2658,2697,3954.
\end{gathered}
\]
Since the run up to \(100000\) also reports \(33\) failures, these are all
the failures observed in that range.

The next viable target is not Lemma G as stated.  It is either:

1. prove a finite-exception version of the square-offset lemma and handle the
   exceptional classes by another offset family; or
2. use the square-offset data as a structured subcover inside the full
   residue-cover formulation.

## Gaussian failure offset analysis

Added
\[
  \texttt{Math/conjecture/legendre/tools/gaussian\_failure\_analyzer.py}.
\]
For each failure of the strict square-offset lemma, it finds the first actual
prime in the Legendre interval and writes its offset as
\[
  m=t^2+r,
\]
choosing the nearest square.

For the \(33\) strict failures observed up to \(100000\), the first prime
offset is always very close to a square:
\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
  |r| & \text{number of failures} \\
  \hline
  1 & 14 \\
  2 & 10 \\
  3 & 7 \\
  4 & 1 \\
  5 & 1.
\end{array}
\]
Thus every observed strict failure is repaired by the broadened offset family
\[
  n^2+t^2+r,\qquad |r|\le5.
\]
The smaller band \(|r|\le4\) covers \(32/33\) failures; the unique \(|r|=5\)
case in this run is
\[
  n=1284,\qquad n^2+41=1648697,\qquad 41=6^2+5.
\]

This suggests the next experimental lemma:

Lemma \(G_5\) candidate. For every \(n\ge2\), there exist integers
\[
  1\le t\le\lfloor\sqrt{2n}\rfloor+1,\qquad |r|\le5,
\]
such that
\[
  1\le t^2+r\le 2n
\]
and \(n^2+t^2+r\) is prime.

This no longer has the clean Gaussian-norm divisor exclusion when \(r\ne0\),
but it may be the correct empirical bridge: square norms provide the main
skeleton, and a bounded correction handles the sparse failures.
